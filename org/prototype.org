#+SETUPFILE: setup.hrg
#+INCLUDE: header.hrg

The prototype offline application runs on Mac OS X and iPhone and iPad.
It was built in one month using:

- real time OpenGL exported from Blender scripts,
- scalable vector graphics for textures and UI and actors,
- dynamic lighting
- beautiful Core Animation movements, actions and effects,
- turn based combat and movement,
- inventory and equipment,
- random room selection and map,
- warps,
- AI,
- generated items and monsters.

* Status

  - The prototype can be found in [[/Gamelike.app.zip][Gamelike.app.zip]]
  - It is currently being ported to the [[webclient.org][Web client]].
  - There has been initial networking support being added if it were to be
    continued to be supported as an official game client for
    the [[valhalla.org][Valhalla server]].

* Notes

  - Map is 'm' and Inventory is 'i'.
  - Movement is number pad.
  - The sword and shield are backwards for an uneventful reason. ^_^
  - The warps between rooms are in the very center of the walls.
  - There were 'door lights' to show the way but this version is a bit in between things and just before it was decided to be made multiplayer and portable.
  - Also walking into walls is fun. =)
