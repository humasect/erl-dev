* Ideas
  - "An oubliette (from the French oubliette - literally "forgotten place") was
    a form of dungeon which was accessible only from a hatch in a high ceiling.
    The word comes from the same root as the French oublier, "to forget,"
    as it was used for those prisoners the captors wished to forget."
